R-1011,BM-09,Sn0.988Te,False,ambient,,not_reported,,,,,"Single crystals of Sn.988−xInxTe were grown by an un-seeded physical vapor transport method. This method was specifically chosen because it results in a relatively high Sn vacancy concentration, suppressing the structural phase transition so that additional scattering associated with the In impurities can be studied in isolation. For nominal In concentrations, xnom < 10%, starting material in the SnTe:In:Te ratio (1-xnom):xnom:xnom were ground thoroughly and pressed into a pellet. The pellet was sintered at 600 ◦C for 36 hrs. The resulting polycrystalline pellet was ground, pressed, and sintered once more. For higher In concentrations, a thorough grind before the first sinter step was not possible, as the metal is highly malleable. In these cases, the starting materials were coarsely ground, pressed, and sintered before it could be thoroughly ground for the second sinter. For these materials, a third sinter was also performed, to ensure a homogeneous mixture. For all In concentrations, the resulting pellet was then coarsely crushed, placed at the center of a 10 cm long evacuated quartz tube, and heated to 750 degrees for 9 days under a temperature gradient of 1◦C/cm. The resulting single crystals, which grew at the cooler ends of the quartz ampoule, were then annealed 12 hours at 550 C in an inert environment to improve homogeneity, determined by reproducibility of resistivity measurements. The composition was measured by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), using PbTe as a tellurium standard, In metal, and Sn metal standards. Material of measured In concentration, x = 0%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 2.7%, 3.8%, 6.1%, 6.5%, 7.3%, and 8.4% were analyzed in this way."

To obtain Na3P, Na (Sigma-Aldrichi, 99.9%) and P in a ratio of 3 : 1 were heated at 300 °C for 10 h in an evacuated quartz tube. A surface oxide layer of Na was mechanically cleaved before experiments. A stoichiometric mixture of Na3P : Sn : P = 1 : 3 : 2 was pressed into a pellet and heated at 400 °C for 20 h in an evacuated quartz tube. The obtained product was ground, mixed, pelletized, and heated again at 400 °C for 40 h in an evacuated quartz tube. The sample preparation procedures were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox with a gas-purifier system or under vacuum. The obtained sample was stored in an Ar-filled glovebox because it is reactive in air and moist atmosphere."

The raw materials were then mixed with the total weight of 4.0 g and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The sealed quartz tubes were heated up to 1123 K and kept for 48 h with intermittent shaking to ensure homogeneity of the melt. The tubes were subsequently cooled down to 823 K at a rate of 5 K/h and, then, quenched into ice-water.

In each step to prepare the sample, we managed carefully it due to Tl metal poison. Single crystals with a typical dimension of 2×2×0.2mm3 [see Fig. 1(b)], were mechanically isolated from the flux.

The exact composition of TlNi2Se2 indicates that Ni ions should be a mixed valance of Ni1.5+ due to Tl having monovalence. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern [see Fig. 1(d)] at room temperature of the TlNi2Se2 powder by grinding pieces of crystals confirms its ThCr2Si2-type structure, and its Rietveld refinement (reliability factor: Rwp= 9.53%, χ2= 2.671) gives the lattice parameters of a = 3.87(±0.01) Å and c = 13.43(±0.01) Å and an evidence of no vacancies existing at each sites."

Our samples were systematically characterized by x-ray diA'raction with a Guinier-Laine Camera (Cu ECa) and are single phase."

As starting materials served the elements Er, Pd and Bi with a purity of 3N5, 4N and 5N, respectively. An ingot of ErPdBi was prepared by arc-melting and placed in an alumina crucible with excess Bi flux. The crucible and contents were heated in a quartz tube under a pressure of 0.3 bar high-purity argon gas to 1150 °C and kept at this temperature for 36 h. Then the tube was slowly cooled to 500 °C at a rate of 3 °C per hour to form the crystals."

The starting materials used were La chips (99.9%), Sb powder (99.9%) and Pd powder (99.9%). Stoichiometric amounts of these elements were mixed inside a nitrogen-filled glove box, pelletized, heat-treated at 900 °C for 40 h and quenched. The obtained specimen was ground, pelletized and heated at 900 °C for 40 h again before quenching to room temperature."
