## Description

This repository contains the code used to host a Streamlit-based website that provides a curated database of crystal structures of superconductors.  
The dataset is generated through text mining and benchmarking of **60 research articles**.

## Workflow

![Workflow Diagram](RAG_WF.png)

This benchmarking is currently performed using the **Gemini File Search RAG model** as implemented in `google-genai`.
