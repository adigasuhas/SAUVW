# Text Mined Crystal Structure Database of Superconductors

![Project Logo](SAUVW.png)

## Description

This repository contains the code used to host a Streamlit-based website that provides a curated database of crystal structures of superconductors.  
The dataset is generated through text mining and benchmarking of **60 research articles**.

## Workflow
