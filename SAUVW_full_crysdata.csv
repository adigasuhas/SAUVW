All room-temperature processing (weighing, mixing, grinding and storage) was carried out in an Ar filled glove-box. In the first step, the precursor materials (CaAs, Fe2As and Co2As) were prepared by reacting stoichiometric quantities of the constituents under vacuum at temperatures less than 900 ºC. In the second step, stoichiometric quantities of the pre-reacted materials CaAs, Co2As and Fe2As were weighed, grounded and pressed into pellets and sealed in a quartz ampoule under vacuum. The ampoule was slowly heated to 750 ºC, kept there for 10 h and then further heated to 850 ºC for another 15 h before cooling to room temperature. In the final step, the sintered Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 pellets and the Sn shots, taken in a molar ratio of 1 : 30, were placed in an alumina crucible together with a second catch crucible containing quartz wool and subsequently sealed in an quartz ampoule under vacuum. The charge was slowly heated to 1090 ºC, kept there for 24 h to ensure the homogenization and then cooled down to 600 ºC under a slow cooling rate of 2.5 ºC per hour. At this temperature, the Sn flux was decanted by flipping the ampoule up-side-down. After 3-4 h of waiting, the ampoule was cooled down to room temperature by switching off the furnace."

The sealed quartz tubes were heated up to 1123 K and kept for 48 h with intermittent shaking to ensure homogeneity of the melt. The tubes were subsequently cooled down to 823 K at a rate of 5 K/h and, then, quenched into ice-water.
